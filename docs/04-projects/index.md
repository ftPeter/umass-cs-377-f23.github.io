# Projects

There are approximately 6 projects that are hands on with programming as it relates to the material. You will be provided a “starter” project, but will require additions, modifications, or tasks to complete it. Most projects come with some tests (but not all) to guide you. You submit your projects to Gradescope which will run our auto-grader and apply additional private tests.
