# Lectures

**Lecture** will provide an overview of the topics concerned with operating systems. Typical classes will follow a lecture-style presentation of the material with interaction from students based on examples covered. You are expected to attend lectures regularly. Lectures will also be available live on zoom and recorded for viewing after class. We provide this flexibility for your busy lives, but please do not abuse it. We do expect you to attend class on a regular basis.

You will find the lecture material as well as the associated reading in each of the lecture pages on the left. You will find it helpful to review this material to better understand the concepts presented.
