# Honors

The honors section of this course delves deeper into the actual implementation of a unix-like operating system. In particular, we investigate the implementation details of the [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) operating system. xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6). xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C. We will touch upon various implementation parts of the OS that correspond to the theoretical coverage presented in COMPSCI 377. However, we are likely to not follow the topics in the same order because of the design of the operating system.

This course will have assignments that are in line with a 1-credit, 3 hours a week, workload.
