# Meeting 02 Introduction to xv6

## Build and Run xv6 Operating System!

Today, we are going to build and run the xv6 operating system!

### Objective

Get ready to dive into the exciting world of systems programming by building and running a simple operating system! The xv6 operating system is a simple Unix-like operating system developed by MIT as a teaching tool for operating systems courses. And today, we're going to take on the challenge of building and running this OS in our classroom!

### Instructions

Woohoo! Let's get started by forking the xv6 source code (see link below)

It's time to roll up our sleeves and set up our development environment! Follow the [easy-peasy instructions](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2022/tools.html) on MITs OS website. You will need a Linux or macOS system with a C compiler, a text editor, and the QEMU emulator. **Note:** this might be easy or it might be hard. Regardless, it will take up the entire class time.

After your are all set up, it's time to study the xv6 source code and accompanying documentation to gain an understanding of how the operating system works. This is going to be so much fun! We'll get to know how the system calls, file system, and process management code work.
